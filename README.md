## Overview:
This repository hosts the collaborative efforts of a group project conducted as part of the "Data Science for Business" course. Focused on the dynamic music industry of the 21st century, where an overwhelming 100,000 songs are released daily, our investigation addresses the challenges faced by music producers in predicting the success of their creations.

## Objective:
The primary aim of this project is to unravel patterns and correlations among diverse musical attributes in popular songs. We strive to mitigate risks and increase the likelihood of success by determining a potential "recipe" for a hit song. This involves a dual approach, incorporating exploratory analysis to understand the characteristics of top songs on Spotify in 2023 and hypothesis-testing to validate the existence of a formula for success.

## Finding and Application:

**Finding:**

1. There are several factors that contribute to a songâ€™s streaming performance (on Spotify). For example, songs with extremely high energy levels may not be as popular. A hyperactive heavy metal song might not resonate with listeners seeking a more mellow experience.

2. The year of release, inclusion in Spotify playlists, and appearance in Spotify charts play important role in predicting song popularity. This predictive insight implies that music producers and artists can strategically control these factors to  potentially boost streaming performance.

3. There are factors that music producers can base on to predict if a song has a good streaming performance or not, such as energy level, acoustic level, beats per minute, liveliness, and danceability.


**Application:**

The results of this study hold substantial value for various stakeholders in the music industry. 
Music producers and artists can use these insights to craft more successful songs by considering factors such as optimizing release timing, and striving for inclusion in Spotify playlists and charts. To predict a song's potential for popularity, music producers should also consider the balance energy levels, excessive spoken content, and be mindful of song key choices to avoid potential pitfalls.

And for streaming platforms and social media controllers, the predictive implications from these findings lies in the ability to proactively identify songs with the right characteristics, such as energy levels, release year, chart presence, and content mix, that align with listener preferences, thereby increasing the likelihood of retaining and engaging users by offering songs that have a higher potential for popularity.
